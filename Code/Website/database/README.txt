Dump SQL datafiles

1: go to localhost/phpmyadmin
2: make a new table that is equivalent to the sql file name
	i.e) memebership.sql --> create a database called "membership"
3: Click on the database and then press import
4: Find the sql file and then press ok. 
5: Even if there are errors, check if the database is now on your phpmyadmin server
